# Blog Project
## Description
Created the base template of a blog web application using a node and express backend. This project uses dynamic routing to create new pages based on an ejs template and the content of a blog post. The user can create a new blog post by navigating to the compose route, entering information into the title and content boxes, then clicking the publish button to submit. Once redirected to the home route, the user should be able to see the new blog post below with a link that leads to the posting page. However, the user can also navigate to a particular blog post by entering /posts/BlogName into the search bar. This navigation technique should work regardless of case, but will need dashes in the place of spaces.
