## Each folder represents a different project

### Blog
* This project uses dynamic routing to create new pages whenever a blog post is added, based on an ejs layout. Users can add blog posts by going to the /compose route. Additionally, users are able to find past blog posts by navigating to the /posts/BlogName route.
* Site: https://still-eyrie-29380.herokuapp.com/

### Mailing Page
* Used the mailchimp api and bootstrap example log in template to build a web application which takes in a user's email, first name, and last name, then signs them up to a mailchimp mailing list. If the user was successfully signed up, the site will load a successful sign up page, however, if the request failed, a failure page will show instead.

### Todo List
* Used ejs to design a template where the current date is the title. This web application allows a user to insert items into an array as a simple version of a todo list. Additionally, there is a work route for a separate work todo list and an about page, all made with ejs.

### Weather Api
* Used the open weather map api to retrieve information about the weather at a certain location and display that data on a basic web application. The location of which the weather information is displayed is dependent on the user's input.

### Fruits Database
* Used MongoDB to create a new database, insert items, and search for items. This project serves as a basic introduction to MongoDB and CRUD.

### Calculator
* Very simple project, which takes in two user inputs (both numbers), adds them together, and displays the result on the home route. This projects serves as a basic introduction to Nodejs and Expressjs.
